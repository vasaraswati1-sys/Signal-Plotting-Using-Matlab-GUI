# Signal-Plotting-Using-Matlab-GUI
plotting-signal-using Matlab-GUII have plotted 4 types of signal including sine signal,square signal,triangular signal,and composite signal by using matlab GUII
sine signal: sin function from matlab
square signal:square function
Triangular signal:sawtooth function
Composit signal:addition of sine ,square and triangular signal
